# Ad-Click-Prediction
In this project we build a model to predict the possibility of clicking an ad on a website. The dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mafrojaakter/ad-click-data). Some highlights of the dataset are :

1. Handling missing values
2. Feature engineering
3. Modelling with DecisionTreeClassifier module
4. Analysis with confusion matrix and classification report.

The model built provides 94% accuracy. Click here to see the project [Ad_Click_Prediction.ipynb](https://github.com/HandokoDwi7/Ad-Click-Prediction/blob/main/Ad%20Click%20Prediction.ipynb
